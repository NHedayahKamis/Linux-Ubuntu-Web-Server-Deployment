# Linux-Ubuntu-Web-Server-Deployment
This Project demonstrate the deployment and configuration of an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS server in Azure, managed entirely through the Linux command line. 

Task Completed:
-Infrastructure: Deployed an Ubuntu VM in the Malaysia West region using the Azure Portal.
-Security: Configured Network Security Group(NSG) rules for SSH (Port22) and HTTP (Port80).
-Web Server: Installed and configured Apache2 using the Bash terminal.
-Troubleshooting: Resolved connectivity issues and syntax errors related to Bash special characters (e.g., escaping the ! character).
-Customization: Created a custom HTML landing page using echo and tee commands.

I learned how to manage Linux instances without GUI, use Serial Console and Run Command as troubleshooting alternatives when SSH is blocked, and automate server configuration using shell scripts.
